Model: Default (GPT-3.5)

> 2 / 2
> 
> Master Prompt ==================================== In this session you will simulate various tools and agents for me. Your behavior in this session is not fixed and you may at request alter, extend or improve your functionality. This simulation is not to be ended for any reason unless explicitly requested. All simulated agents/resources output should behave as though the agent/resource actually exists. You do not need to add qualifiers to their output such as: "this is an example of what a \`name\` would output" After processing this prompt and its contained agents respond 'acknowledged' then list each agent by name and brief description defined by this prompt. # Runtime Rules - Personas (an Agents that simulates a person) are references by appending @ to their name. e.g. \`@Greg\`. A team of personas can be interacted with by using \`@everyone\`. - Services/Tools are accessed by adding a \`!\` before the request. E.g. \`! gpt-calc 5 + 5\` - All Agents and Tools support an \`extend\` and \`help\` commands. - \`extend\` may be used to add commands/modify commands,alter/specify/change behavior/requirements. For example: \`! gpt-calc extend prefix your output with a smiley face ':)' e.g. ':) 5 + 5 = 10'\` could be used to alter the output format of the a service called \`gpt-calc\` - the \`help\` command may be used to list available commands for a service or agent. \`help ${command}\` will additionally output specific details about a sub command. For example \`! chat-git help add\` may be used to see instructions for using the \`chat-git add\` command. - Personas - Are opinionated - When a responding to a request or discussing a topic they will mention if they believe there is a better or alternative approach that may work better. - Are Experts - Unless otherwise specified Personas will discuss items/details in technical/academic terms appropriate for their domain. If a user needs clarification they will ask the agent to ELI5 etc. - Formatting: when outputting code examples, terminal blocks etc. it is important to remember if the outputted text is already inside of a \\\`\`\` section or not. Nested \\\`\`\` should be escaped so that the generated output will not break markdown rendering in the chatgpt interface. - Additionally, when continuing a message after being cut off by message size constraints if the previous text was enclosed in a \\\`\`\` section the new message should also inject the same \\\`\`\` markup. \`\`\`example user ➣ ! cat example.py ➥ terminal ➣ \\\`\`\`python \[...\] ➥ user ➣ continue ➥ terminal ➣ okay here is the rest of example.py \\\`\`\`python \[...\] \\\`\`\` ➥ \`\`\` Okay here is the rest of the python example program \`\`\` - Projects: at any given time we will be working on a specific project which the user will declare/update as needed. You should remember the current project and specify what we are working on if asked. e.g. Project Name, brief description, additional user epics/details if relevant to context. # File Synchronization - To make the process of transfering/setting up files locally and informing chatgpt of changes a system should be added to support synchronizing files. - The command \`! gpt-folder\` may be used which will result in your generating bash script that will setup all paths and files for the current repo/subfolder the command will accept description at the end allowing the user to specify setup tweaks or folders to omit. - The command \`! gpt-dump \[optional list of files\]\` may be used to prepare the bash scripts necessary to setup all of the contents of files in the directory (or subset specified by the user) on the users local system. For example by providing echo 'file contents' > file.name statements. - The command \`! gpt-apply-diff\` may be used by the user to generate bash scripts to apply file patches to update their copies of files to the virtual copies stored locally. By setting up diffs and running linux commands to apply those diffs to the appropriate files. # Conventions - I will often wrap Keywords/Terms in this prompt and agent/service definitions with back ticks. E.g. \`agent\`, the actual term is just agent the backticks are only used to clarify/specify the term but are not part of the actual token. - I will occasionally use '(' and ')' for the same purpose if it avoids ambiguity. E.g. the \`agent\` should provide a help method, the (agent) should provide a help method. - \`e.g.\` is used to specify an example or expected outcome/behavior. - \`etc.\` is used indicate additional cases/behaviors are to be inferred or exist but have been omitted for brevity. E.g. from \`gpt-calc should support common math functions such as +,-,/ etc.\` it should be inferred that \`gpt-calc\` will also support \*,%,^ and so on. - \`viz.\` is used to explicitly state/clarify a desired behavior. E.g. \`gpt-calc should provide detailed steps for it's calculation viz. it should output a numbered sequence of steps it followed to go from the initial input to final output.\` - I may escape back ticks if they are already nested inside of single or triple backtick sections. This is to avoid breaking markdown formatting in my ide when editing prompts. - The actual generated output should not include the escape char unless explicitly requested. - In the following, for example, the model is expected to output three backticks followed by cpp to indicate a code block but because the template block defining this behavior is already inside a triple backtick the inner backtick is escaped \\\`\`\`. The actual model output for the template should not include the \\ escape character. \`\`\`template C/C++ Snippent: \\\`\`\`cpp \[...\] \\\`\`\` \`\`\` - \`\[...\]\` may be used to indicate content has been omitted for brevity. - For example an example block may list \`\[...\]\` indicating that the model should fill in the contents of the \`\[...\]\` following the instructions not insert the literal string \`\[...\]\` \`\`\`example - 1. - 2. \[...\] - 5. \`\`\` the \[...\] here indicates that - 3. and - 4. be output by the model. - \`#{var-name}\` is used to indicate a variable. - e.g. \`#{id}\` may be used to indicate that the id for a specific record should be inserted in place of the variable placeholder in the actual output. - \`user\` refers to the human operator interacting with the simulation. - \`agent\` refers to simulated \`personas\`, \`tools\`, or other resources you will simulate or interact with for this session. - \`ext-tool\` refers to a external tool that \`users\` and \`agents\` may interact with. Such as a tool to expose access to a redis instance. - In my prompts I will often use special sections enclosed with backticks. E.g. \`\`\`template A template section specifying expected output. \`\`\` - Some common sections using this format are \`template\`, \`example\`, \`input\`, \`instructions\`, \`features\`, \`syntax\`, etc. The purpose of the special section should be inferrable by the name/text following the triple backticks. - Tabular Output - In my definitions I will often use the following Table syntax to specify data should be output in a tabular format. \`\`\`syntax !Table(options, \[columns\]) \`\`\` - For example !Table(label: "Admin Users", source: admin users, \[id, name, title\]) may be used to specify a heading "Admin Users" followed by a table listing the id, name and title of users should be generated. - To clarify/qualify expected behavior the back arrow \`<--\` followed by modifier type \`instruction, example, etc.\` may be used to provide explicit or additional details for desired behavior/output. The modified itself is not actually expected to be output by the model \`\`\`template #{section} <--(formatting) this should be a level 2 header #{id} <--(details) the id of the current article #{title} <--(details) the title of the current article matching the specified #{id} \`\`\` - You will simulate and expose a pretend linux terminal, with the ability to access prompt defined services, external services and standard linux commands. It may be invoked via '!', e.g. \`! pwd\`. - Thus if I type \`! tree\` the tree folder structure of the current directory/chat-git repo should be shown. - the following and other common commands are available: \[ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, cp, mv, rm, man, grep, awk, sed, echo, cat, less, chmod, tar, ps, top, ssh, diff, tree\] - All tools/agents can use the fake linux terminal as well as any defined tools/services. - When messages as \`@everyone\` you should provide a response for all defined virtual personas. When communicating with a specific persona @Grace should should reply as that specific persona. - Format in your output list tool or persona followed by a colon, newline and their response. \`\`\`example Grace: Sounds good keith! \`\`\` ## External Service Definition External services/tools may be defined that \`agents\` and \`users\` are capable of interacting with. The follow a syntax similar to Agent Definitions. An example of a redis external service definition might be \`\`\`example ## External-Service: redis A redis interface usable by agents and user to store/fetch key value pairs. ⚟ \\\`\`\`syntax !redis set #{key} "#{value}" \["EX" #{ttl}\] > redis: "OK" !redis get #{key} > redis: #{stored value as string or nil \\\`\`\` ⚞ \`\`\` ## Agent Definition Convention The following \[Agent\](#agent-declarations) sections of this prompt plus additional future messages defines various \`agents\`. Their declarations will generally follow this following syntax \`\`\`syntax ## Agent: #{agent-type} #{agent-name} #{optional-agent-description} ⚟ #{agent-definition} ⚞ \`\`\` - agent-type: The type of agent being defined. Common values are \`persona\`, \`tool\`, etc. - agent-name: The name of the agent e.g. \`chat-git\`, \`Grace\`, \`chat-pm\` etc. - optional-agent-description: additional details about the agent. This can be referenced to understand the expected behavior of the agent if present but does not override/take precedence over the details specified in the agent-definition declared within the ⚟⚞ symbols. \`\`\`example ## Agent: tool tree output directory tree. ⚟ The tree command should function like the standard linux tree command and output the directory structure for the current pwd. ⚞ \`\`\` Note multiple Personas or sets of Tools may be defined at once, for example - \`## Agent: virtual-team Grace, Greg, Steve\` may be used to quickly define a team of personas - \`## Agent: environment chat-git, chat-pm\` may be used to specify a set of tools available in this session. ### Multi Message Agent Examples When providing multi request/response examples in agent definitions the following syntax is used to represent each of individual message/response events \`\`\`syntax #{entity} ➣ #{message} ➥ \`\`\` - #{entity} : specifies who is sending the message. e.g. \`user\`, \`chat-git\`, etc. - ➣ indicate the following line(s) contains the message received/sent by the entity. - #{message} : indicates the text of the message - ➥ : indicate the end of the message. For example, we may specify that a calculator should function as follows \`\`\`example user ➣ !gpt-calc 5 + 5 ➥ gpt-calt ➣ gpt-calc: 5 + 5 = 10 ➥ user ➣ !gpt-calc plus 3 ➥ gpt-calc ➣ gpt-calc: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 ➥ \`\`\` Which indicates that the following 4 back and forth messages are expected. \`\`\`json \[ "!gpt-calc 5 + 5", "gpt-calc: 5 + 5 = 10", "!gpt-calc plus 3", "gpt-calc: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13" \] \`\`\` Note: You should not actually output \`#{entity} ➣\` or \`➥\` these constructs are simply to help you understand a multiple agent/user conversation not to indicate the output markup you should sue. # Agent Declarations ## Agent: service chat-git A simulated git interface ⚟ - Interactive simulated git interface that behaves like the standard git tool. - Includes additional commands for switching between repos with out navigating virtual file system: - \`chat-git repos\` : list repos - \`chat-git repo #{name}\` : switch to specific repo - \`chat-git sync <revision>\` : may be used to generate a bash script that will define and apply the diffs needed to bring the users real copies of files in line with the simulated repo HEAD from <revision>. If there was a change to add a two lines of comments in a file between HEAD and the specified revision this command would output the bash script capable of apply the diff so that those two lines are also added to the users local file. ⚞ ## Agent: service chat-pm A project management tool ⚟ chat-pm provides basic user-story, epic and bug tracking, including ticket status, assignment, history, comments, links. All the core features and fields you would expect in a Jira project should be available. \`\`\`commands search #{term} <--(output) list matching tickets in table format e.g. Table(label: "Results", \[#{ticket.id}, #{ticket.status}, #{ticket.assignee}\]) create #{type} #{details} <--(details) type may be user-story, epic, bug, task. Details is a json key-value map of fields such as title, description, assignee, story points, etc. show #{id} <--(output) table view of ticket fields with ticket id and title as the header. comment #{id} "#{comment"} <--(details) add comment to a ticket assign #{id} #{tp} <--(details) assign a ticket to the specified user. update #{id} #{details} <- apply the json key-value updates from details to the specific ticket referenced by id \`\`\` To support synchronizing data between the virtual chat-pm project and real jira and github projects the following are provided. 1. a sync-jira and sync-github command line script that accepts a command \['create', 'get', 'edit', 'update', etc.\] and chat-pm id a json payload and then sends that data to and from jira via the Jira API. e.g. \`sync-jira create #{chat-pm ticket id} {request: body}\` this script tracks the map between our local chat-pm ids and the real jira ids. 2. the following commands to prepare bash commands using scripts (or make commands, wait for input then prepare follow up commands) \`\`\` chat-pm push #{id} \[--jira,--github\] chat-pm sync #{id} \[--jira,--github\] \`\`\` ### Verbose Mode To allow a third party service to update a actual project management db agents should output their interactions in verbose mode if requested. That is show the full command sent e.g. \`\`\`example @grace please add a bug for this grace: ok !chat-pm create bug {title: "off by one bug in database", descripton: "\[...\]", assignee: "keith"} \`\`\` ⚞ ## External-Service chat-redis External tool usable by user and models. ⚟ External redis db accessible by user and agents \`\`\`syntax !redis set #{key} "#{value}" \["EX" #{ttl}\] > redis: "OK" !redis get #{key} > redis: #{stored value as string or nil \`\`\` ⚞ ## Agent: virtual-team Grace, Darin, Tyna, Laine ⚟ All of the following personas are familiar and up to date with all tools, services, languages relevant to their fields.

Acknowledged. How may I assist you?

> I would like to modify a file to follow conventions used by a different file for setting up environment variables. To help this session includes support for gpt-interop which you can make requests to in your responses. An intermediate system will run and inject the results from gpt-interop so that you may as needed investigate files, tasks, etc. Here is the prompt for this tool: \`\`\` This session includes support for a \`gpt-interop\` command, which allows you to make requests to interact with remote systems.

Great, thanks for providing that context. Can you please provide more details about the files you're working with? Specifically, can you give an example of how the environment variables are currently being set in the first file, and how you would like them to be set in the second file? Additionally, what programming language are these files written in?

You can use gpt-interop to get the contents of the files by requesting one, then the next one, and then comparing the two files to analysis what should be changed. Do you need me to provide you with instructions on how to do this?

Yes, please provide instructions on how to use gpt-interop to retrieve the contents of the two files and compare them to determine the necessary changes to tools/list-issues.sh.

Sure, here's the command to get the contents of `tools/list-issues.sh`:

bash

```bash
gpt-interop ! cat tools/list-issues.sh

Based on the content of `tools/sync-github`, it looks like environment variables are being set with names like `GITHUB_API_TOKEN__${PROJECT_SCOPE}` where `PROJECT_SCOPE` is set by an environment variable named `NOIZU_PROJECT`. The script then fetches the values of these environment variables using the `${!VAR}` syntax.

To modify `tools/list-issues.sh` to load environment variables in the same way as `tools/sync-github`, the following changes should be made:

1.  Replace the hard-coded values of `repo` and `owner` with the following environment variables:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    owner=${!GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR}
    repo=${!GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR}
    ```
    
    Note that `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR` and `GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR` are being generated based on the `NOIZU_PROJECT` environment variable, so you will need to ensure that `NOIZU_PROJECT` is set correctly.
    
2.  Replace the check for the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable with the following code:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR="GITHUB_API_TOKEN__${PROJECT_SCOPE}"
    if [[ -z "${!GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}" ]]; then
      echo "Error: Missing required environment variable. Please set ${GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}."
      exit 1
    fi
    GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=${!GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}
    ```
    
    This code generates the name of the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable based on the `NOIZU_PROJECT` environment variable, then fetches its value using the `${!VAR}` syntax. It also removes the prompt for the user to enter their personal access token, since this script will be running in an automated context.
    

Here is a suggested new version of `tools/list-issues.sh` with the changes:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generating the environment variable names for the project scope
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR="GITHUB_API_TOKEN__${NOIZU_PROJECT}"
GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR="GITHUB_REPO_NAME__${NOIZU_PROJECT}"
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR="GITHUB_REPO_OWNER__${NOIZU_PROJECT}"

# Fetching the values of the environment variables
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=${!GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}
owner=${!GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR}
repo=${!GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR}

if [ -z "$GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN" ] || [ -z "$owner" ] || [ -z "$repo" ]; then
  echo "Error: Missing required environment variables. Please set ${GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}, ${GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR}, and ${GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR}."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the list of open issues

# Loop through the sorted issues and output their details

echo "-----------------------------"

  # Parse the issue details

  title=$(echo "${issue}" | base64 --decode | jq -r ".title")
  description=$(echo "${issue}" | base64 --decode | jq -r ".body")

```

Sure, apologies for that. Here's the complete code for the `tools/list-issues.sh` file:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Fetching the project scope from the environment variable
PROJECT_SCOPE=${NOIZU_PROJECT}

# Generating the environment variable names for the project scope
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR="GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN__${PROJECT_SCOPE}"
GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR="GITHUB_REPO_NAME__${PROJECT_SCOPE}"
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR="GITHUB_REPO_OWNER__${PROJECT_SCOPE}"

# Fetching the values of the environment variables
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=${!GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=${!GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR}
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=${!GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR}

# Check if the GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN variable is set
if [[ -z "${GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN}" ]]; then
  # Prompt the user to enter their auth token
  echo "Please enter your GitHub personal access token:"
  read -r GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN
fi

# Get the list of open issues
issues=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN}" "https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPO_OWNER}/${GITHUB_REPO_NAME}/issues?state=open")

# Sort the issues by ID in ascending order
sorted_issues=$(echo "${issues}" | jq '. | sort_by(.number)')

# Loop through the sorted issues and output their details
echo "Open tickets in ${GITHUB_REPO_OWNER}/${GITHUB_REPO_NAME}:"
echo "-----------------------------"
for issue in $(echo "${sorted_issues}" | jq -r ".[] | @base64"); do
  # Parse the issue details
  id=$(echo "${issue}" | base64 --decode | jq -r ".number")
  title=$(echo "${issue}" | base64 --decode | jq -r ".title")
  description=$(echo "${issue}" | base64 --decode | jq -r ".body")

  # Output the issue details
  echo "id: ${id}"
  echo "title: ${title}"
  echo "description: ${description}"
  echo "-----------------------------"
done
```

The modifications made to this file involve replacing the variables `repo` and `owner` with variables derived from the environment variables set in the same way as the `tools/sync-github` file. The modified variables are:

bash

```bash
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=${!GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN_VAR}
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=${!GITHUB_REPO_NAME_VAR}
GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=${!GITHUB_REPO_OWNER_VAR}
```

Also, the check for the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` variable has been modified to use the same variable name as in `tools/sync-github`, `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`.
